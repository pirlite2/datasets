All the datasets in this folder have been obtained from the UCI Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) with the exception of the dow-chemical dataset that was kindly supplied by James McDermott.

Details of the dataset preparation is given in: P.Rockett -- "Constant optimization and feature standardization in multiobjective genetic programming", Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, doi:10.1007/s10710-021-09410-y (2021)

To create the files in each directory, run the make-datasets.sh script file in a shell.
